This is Spy 1, which is a text-based adventure game where you get to be a spy trying to solve a diamond robbery. You get to make choices, investigate clues, and hopefully catch the thief.

This is actually my first Python project, so it is very simple, but it is totally playable, as it is a sign of my initial contribution to the game development area. This is what actually gets me to upload it.
